The Historisch Centrum Leeuwarden (HCL) works as an important archive for the city of Leeuwarden, housing many historically invaluable documents, paintings and artefacts. 
Through our research, we discovered that the HCL proposal and mission is critical for the heritage of the City with a Hundred Names. 
With The Archivist, we want to make the visit to the HCL a memorable experience that will not only teach about Leeuwarden in a playful and interesting way, but also challenge the player to be on the other side of the front desk and let their judgement decide what is or not worth to keep. 
Use your sharp investigation skills to unravel the stories ancient documents and artefacts tell us. 
Become the owner of your Archive and ask yourself: Which relics, old deeds and machinations does the city of Leeuwarden hide? Is there a price for each one of them? Set the value of history itself inâ€¦ The Archivist.
